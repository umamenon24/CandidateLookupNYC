# CandidateLookupNYC

Candidate Lookup NYC will be a platform to help people connect with and support local campaigns in their communities. The problem is a general lack of information and media concerning local candidates and policy. In New York, local elected officials are more impactful to public policy that affects our daily lives, more so than state and national representatives. It is difficult for challenger candidates to get press and frequent redistricting leaves voters unsure of who their representatives are. This website, incorporating Python, HTML, and JS code, would solve this problem by being an easy-to-use platform to get information about candidates by filtering by the office they are running for, their district, party, top platform issues, endorsements, voting records, and other relevant information. The audience would be any New Yorkers looking to get involved in local politics, and especially members of my club at school called “Youth Campaigners.” In this club, I reach out to local campaign managers and set up events for high schoolers in the city to campaign for candidates who are working to solve issues they are passionate about.
